## What happened to Ignite?

I think I got Ignite working, but going back, it doesn't seem to work at all. After starting it per the instructions, it's stopped and I don't know why.

```sh
sudo ignite run tarof429/centos7-ignite --name my-vm --cpus 2  --memory 1GB --size 6GB
INFO[0000] Created VM with ID "9b3269f758f7f2a5" and name "my-vm" 
INFO[0001] Networking is handled by "cni"               
INFO[0001] Started Firecracker VM "9b3269f758f7f2a5" in a container with ID "ignite-9b3269f758f7f2a5" 
[taro@zaxman centos7-ignite]$ sudo ignite ps
VM ID	IMAGE	KERNEL	SIZE	CPUS	MEMORY	CREATED	STATUS	IPS	PORTS	NAME
[taro@zaxman centos7-ignite]$ sudo ignite ps -a
VM ID					IMAGE				KERNEL					SIZE	CPUS	MEMORY		CREATED		STATUS	IPS	PORTS	NAME
9b3269f758f7f2a5			tarof429/centos7-ignite:latest	weaveworks/ignite-kernel:4.19.125	6.0 GB	2	1024.0 MB	6s ago		Stopped			my-vm
d90c5eef-0b50-47f7-af29-ec35b612c6e4	weaveworks/ignite-ubuntu:latest	weaveworks/ignite-kernel:4.19.125	3.0 GB	2	800.0 MB	4d18h ago	Stopped			smoke-test
```

This is really disappointing. Plus I'm tired of prefixing every command with sudo because ignite requires root privileges. 

Is there a way to troubleshoot?

```sh
$ sudo ignite logs 9b3269f758f7f2a5
FATA[0000] VM "9b3269f758f7f2a5" is not running      
```

Well that wasn't very successful.

## Second Attempt with Ignite

Going back to the installation docs at https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/blob/master/docs/installation.md, I realized that Ignite depends on containerd. So I start it.

```
sudo systemctl start containerd
```

And I also forgot to start ignited, although this is needed if manifests are used.

```
sudo systemctl start ignited
```

Then I run ignite ps. Surprise!

```
$ sudo ignite ps
VM ID					IMAGE				KERNEL	SIZE	CPUS	MEMORY		CREATED		STATUS	IPS			PORTS	NAME
d90c5eef-0b50-47f7-af29-ec35b612c6e4	weaveworks/ignite-ubuntu:latest	weaveworks/ignite-kernel:4.19.125	3.0 GB	2	800.0 MB	4d20h ago	Up 4d4h	10.61.0.2, 10.61.0.8		smoke-test
```

I then run my VM.

```
$ sudo ignite run tarof429/centos7-ignite --name my-vm --cpus 2  --memory 1GB --size 6GB
INFO[0001] Created VM with ID "a335f1a05aa87435" and name "my-vm" 
INFO[0001] Networking is handled by "cni"               
INFO[0001] Started Firecracker VM "a335f1a05aa87435" in a container with ID "ignite-a335f1a05aa87435" 
$ sudo ignite ps
VM ID					IMAGE				KERNEL				SIZE	CPUS	MEMORY		CREATED		STATUS	IPS			PORTS	NAME
a335f1a05aa87435			tarof429/centos7-ignite:latest	weaveworks/ignite-kernel:4.19.125	6.0 GB	2	1024.0 MB	6s ago		Up 6s	10.61.0.18			my-vm
d90c5eef-0b50-47f7-af29-ec35b612c6e4	weaveworks/ignite-ubuntu:latest	weaveworks/ignite-kernel:4.19.125	3.0 GB	2	800.0 MB	4d21h ago	Up 4d5h	10.61.0.2, 10.61.0.8		smoke-test
```

All good! I'm also able to SSH to my VM.

```
sudo ssh root@10.61.0.18
root@10.61.0.18's password: 
Last login: Sun Feb 21 00:10:43 2021 from gateway
```

I'm also able to run df.

```
[root@a335f1a05aa87435 ~]# df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/root       5.9G  276M  5.4G   5% /
devtmpfs        493M     0  493M   0% /dev
tmpfs           496M     0  496M   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           496M  6.4M  489M   2% /run

tmpfs           100M     0  100M   0% /run/user/0
```

So Ignite works after all. For now I'll stick to VirtualBox and Vagrant, but it's worth looking into in the near future. There is an important consideration on networking at `https://ignite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/networking/` if I want to make VMs available to the outside world.

## Nnginx ingress woes and success

Moving on, I've been stuck at work trying to get Nginx Ingress to work. I was so frustrated that I tried to get it working on my ArchLinux box but ended up duplicating the problem. I posted on the Rancher forum, with a plea for help on how to get their Nginx Ingress to work. What I mean by "their" is the Nginx Ingress that is integrated with Rancher, which is enabled by editing their configuration file. I really don't like this approach of editing configuration files to get something like Nginx working. 

Today I happened to come across an amazing video on how to get Nginx Ingress working on bare-metal (see the YouTube link below). Instead of using VMs, he is using LXC containers, which I've never used. Also he's using HA Proxy, something else I've never used. I feel so behind! Does that mean that I shouldn't use Metallb? Why use HAProxy instead of Metallb? 

I spent half a Saturday working on a project to get nginx ingress working. And I got it to work thanks to the video at `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chwofyGr80c`. There are a few differences. The main difference is that I used Vagrant with VirtualBox instead of LXC containers. I've never used LXC containers, and I think VirtualBox is  closer to bare-metal. I did have to enable port forwarding on ports 80 and 443 for the nginx pods to be happy. For some reason, the video didn't mention these kinds of issues.
