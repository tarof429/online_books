# Article 1: Mate, Firecracker, and why I started this

There's too many things going on in the software world. Kubernetes in particular is evolving so fast. And then as soon as I though I got a handle on Kubernetes, I discover other potentially interesting projects.

Some people have podcasts, blogs or vlogs. Since I prefer writing, I decided to just keep on writing! But instead of committing large "books" to explore topics, this book is meant to be more of a summary of new things that I've found or learned.

## The Mate Desktop

Which brings me to my first real topic. For the first time in several years, I tried a different desktop and rather like it. I've been using `https://awesomewm.org/` for several years and still think the user interface is rather pleasing. If there are any weaknesses, it's configuration. Otherwise it does the job.

But lately I've felt like I should run a screensaver to lock the session. When I installed Xscreensaver, however, I got locked out while watching a movie. That shouldn't happen. So I uninstalled Xscreensaver and wondered if there were any other screensavers worth looking into.

While perusing the list of screensavers on `https://aur.archlinux.org/` I discovered one related to the mate project. That then prompted me to look into the associated project link at `https://mate-desktop.org/`. What won me over was the Control Center, which I'd vaguely though I'd seen before in a more fancy form in Ubuntu. 

Installing mate on ArchLinux was very easy. I installed it using the meta package called mate. A bonus: it worked the first time after I added `exec mate-session` in ~/.xinitrc. 

After rebooting and starting mate, I decided that I wanted to have other accessories. So I installed mate-media and mate-screensaver. Both worked! This could be a keeper. 

## Firecracker

I'm not sure where I heard of `https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/`, but I think it was by accident. Maybe you haven't either, but you've heard of Kata Containers. Actually Kata Containers use Firecracker underneath. So what is firecracker?

Firecracker is a virtual machine monitor and creates/manages KVMs, or Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machines. Let's look at their features:

- Startup times are supposed to be fast -- something that I think is a weakness for VirtualBox images except for personal development. 
- Low memory overhead -- not sure if this is an issue with VirtualBox, as I'm typically running full-blown OSes like CentOS. 
- Ability to run thousands of microVMs on the same machine -- well this is something that I'd never consider with VirtualBox, again because I'm running full-blown OSes. 
- Ability to control Firecracker using RESTful APIs -- well this is something that is lacking in VirtualBox. I typcially use Vagrant, which is fine for personal development but not for production systems.
- Isolated from Linux user-space -- I don't think VirtualBox has any security features, but this might be important in a production environment.

All this sounds great, but it's still a bit of a challenge to figure out how to use it. A good starting point is their git repo at `https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker` which as a link to their quick-start guide at `https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md`. In it, their are a lot of manual steps. It certainly looks daunting to use on a regular basis for a production environment. 

That seems to be why firecracker is used as a base project for so-called container runtimes like Kata Containers and Weaveworks Ignite. 

Weaveworks, which has a github page at `https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite`, looks very interesting. Using weaveworks, you tell what docker image you want to run as a VM, and use Ignite (which is a command-line) to run it as a VM! What's more, startup times are fast (they claim that a VM will start in about 125 milliseconds). 

Kata containers at `https://katacontainers.io/` is similar. Like weaveworks, Kata Containers are lightweight VMs that behave like containers. There's a corresponding page `https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kata_Containers` which explains the various ways to run Kata containers.

There's a third project that caught my attention: `https://github.com/innobead/kubefire`. 

If containers sound confusing, maybe `https://www.inovex.de/blog/containers-docker-containerd-nabla-kata-firecracker/` is a good place ot try to diffuse the term.
